ETherScanViewer is a cross platform desktop application for viewing
and analysing .csn files generated by the PhaseCheckâ„¢ manufactured by ETherNDE Ltd.
The .csn files contain information about the instrument - encoded in XML format,
and eddy current C-scan measurement data - encoded in binary.

Written using the PyQt5 framework, it is compiled to work on Windows, macOS and Linux operating systems.
The scan data is plotted using matplotlib, carefully customised to enable smooth animations for real time updates to the
plots as analysis parameters are changed. Data storage is achieved using a sqlite3 database bundled with the application.

The application decodes the C-scan information and enables the user to visualise the data processed by the instrument.
The user is also able to further process the data by applying visual transformations such as:
- Resistive component (X).
- Reactive component (Y).
- Magnitude (Vector Length).
- Phase angle (Phase).
- Phase shifting.
- Data balancing to normalise to a horizontal or vertical A-scan line.

The application also includes features such as:
- Persistence and retrieval of image visualisation preferences.
- Persistence, and retrieval of analysis values such as the phase shift, and thresholding bounds.
- Vertical and Horizontal A-Scan visualisation.
- Various colour maps for better visualisation.
- Image generation in .png or .jpg image formats.
