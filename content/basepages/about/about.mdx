<div className="content-bg">

I am a Doctor of Engineering, specialised in eddy current non-destructive evaluation. A versatile engineer,
I have extensive experience in building electronics,
signal and image processing, web and desktop software development in a multitude of programming languages,
instrument control, and modelling physical phenomena using analytical and finite element methods.

I attended the University of Sussex, UK, where I obtained my Master of Engineering (MEng)
degree and finished with First Class Honours. I went on to study for my doctorate (EngD) at the University of Warwick, UK.â€¨
My doctoral research was centred on finding novel ways to optimise eddy current arrays by
investigating methods of improving data acquisition, and data processing in order to detect
and characterise flaws in materials with low electrical conductivity.
In the process, I built a prototype system, which was able to detect cracks as small as 0.25 mm
in very low conductivity materials with a high signal to noise ratio.
I also created extensive finite models, which visualised, and explained the interaction between eddy current probes,
and flaws in test samples.

My main passion however, is data processing and analysis. In my role as a design engineer,
I take a data driven approach to improving the algorithms in the instruments we manufacture using machine learning.
I am also quite interested in desktop, and web application development, which has seen me expand my current role to
include the duties of a software engineer, and write a multitude of desktop software with functions
ranging from instrument data collection, to data manipulation, and visualisation; primarily using the python,
and c# programming languages. [View my project portfolio](/projects).
My other interests and hobbies include future technology, fitness, and photography.

I am always very open to collaborate. [Please get in touch](/contact).
