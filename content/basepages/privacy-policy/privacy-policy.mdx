<div className="content content-bg row flex">

I use Google Analytics for aggregated, anonymized website traffic analysis.
In order to track your session usage, Google drops a cookie (_ga) with a randomly-generated ClientID in your browser.
This ID is anonymized and contains no identifiable information like email, phone number, name, etc.
I also send Google your IP Address. I use GA to track aggregated website behavior, such as what pages you looked at, for how long, and so on.
This information is important to me for improving the user experience and determining site effectiveness.
If you would like to access what browsing information I have, or ask me to delete any GA data - please delete your _ga cookies, and
reach out to me [via this form](/contact).

Your browser also stores a cookie in local storage, which records your preference for dark or light mode
when browsing the site.
