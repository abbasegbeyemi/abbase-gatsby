Kawe is a concept book review platform, which enables users to review books they have read,
and to read reviews written by other users. It also displays book cover images, and average ratings from Goodreads.
The user is able to search a database containing thousands of books using details such as the ISBN, year of publication,
or the author.

The application is written with HTML, CSS, and vanilla javascript for the front end, and Flask for the back end. The database
is built using PostgreSQL.
