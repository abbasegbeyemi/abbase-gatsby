ETherScanViewer is a cross platform desktop application for viewing
and analysing .csn files generated by the PhaseCheckâ„¢ manufactured by ETherNDE Ltd.
The .csn files contain information about the instrument - encoded in XML format,
and eddy current C-scan measurement data - encoded in binary.

Version 2 was rewritten from the ground up to replace matplotlib with PyQtGraph for rendering the graphs, due to
the optimization of the latter for user interactivity. The user interface was
redesigned to be more attractive, and easier to use. many more features were added such as:

- The application can recall recent files, which can be easily reopened with a click of a button.
- A more comprehensive menu system.
- Image filtering.
- The ability to more closely analyse specific sections of the data using region of interest indicators.
- Data thresholding using an intensity histogram.

and many others.
